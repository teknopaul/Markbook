# Markbook

Markbook is a couple of `#!/bin/js` scripts used to convert Markdown files into an HTML book with cover page and table of contents.

This is probably pushing the limits of what `#!/bin/js` is desinged for but the idea is to create docs for `#!/bin/js` itself so using anything else would be just silly.

The `#!/bin/js` documentation is generated with a bunch of little scripts so this project just collates those and makes them a tad more generic so they can be re-used.

No intallation is needed for Markbook, just checkout the code and run the `bin/markbook` script, but you do need #!/bin/js installed.
